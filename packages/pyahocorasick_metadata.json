  "summary": "pyahocorasick is a fast and memory efficient library for exact or approximate multi-pattern string search.  With the ``ahocorasick.Automaton`` class, you can find multiple key string occurrences at once in some input text.  You can use it as a plain dict-like Trie or convert a Trie to an automaton for efficient Aho-Corasick search. And pickle to disk for easy reuse of large automatons. Implemented in C and tested on Python 3.6+. Works on Linux, macOS and Windows. BSD-3-Cause license.",
